# CSE4001 - Assignment 4: Add two more system calls to OS/161 üí• 

This repository contains the code base of the OS/161 kernel that you will use to complete this assignment. In this assignment, you will implement the following:

- **Two new system calls** , i.e., `add_three_integers()` and `print_int()`). Here, you will need to implement all the steps needed to add a system call to the OS. 
- **A user-level program to test both system calls**. This is a single test program for testing the two new system calls. 

### **Syscall**: `int add_three_integers(int a, int b, int c)`

This system call will have number 43 as its ID. If this ID number is being used then just choose another one that is not being used. 

This system call receives three integers as input and returns their sum (i.e., `sum = a + b + c`). 
The implementation is a bit more involved than the implementation of the `hello()` system call. First, the function accepts three input arguments. Another difference is that the user-level version of `add_three_numbers()` returns an integer value (i.e., the sum of the three input arguments). 

In the system-call handler (i.e., the file `syscall.c` that has the `switch/case` block), the call to the kernel-level implementation must return an integer value that is either 0 (i.e., success) or nonzero (i.e., an error code). Given this restriction, the return value of the kernel-level prototype cannot be the sum of the numbers. To be able to acquire the value of the sum from the kernel-level function, you will pass the return variable (i.e., `retval`) as an input argument by *reference* to the kernel-version of `add_three_integers`. Passing an argument by reference in C-language is done by passing the address of the variable. 

The prototype of the kernel-level function will then be `int sys_add_three_integers(int a, int b, int c, int *retval)`. Note that, in this case, the prototype of the user-level function (i.e., the function that is called by the user-level test program) which is declared as `int add_three_integers(int a, int b, int c)` differs from the kernel-level version by an extra input argument (i.e., the reference to the `retval` variable). This difference will not cause any problems, as long as the list of argument types are placed in the order matching the arguments of the user-level prototype.

The variable `retval` will be passed by reference to the function, which is C-language means that the address of `retval` will be passed as an argument to the function, i.e.: 

```c
err = sys_add_three_integers(..., ..., ..., &retval);
```

The kernel-level implementation of `sys_add_three_integers` looks like:

```c
int sys_add_three_integers(int a, int b, int c, int* retval_ptr)
{
    ...

    *retval_ptr = s1 + s2 + s3;

    return 0;
}
```
Note that, when calling the function, the address of `retval` is passed as an argument to the function. This argument address is stored in the pointer-to-an-integer variable declared as `int* retval_ptr`. When inside the `sys_add_three_integers` function, assigning a value to the memory location pointed by `retval_ptr` is done by using by dereferencing the pointer, i.e., `*retval_ptr = s1 + s2 + s3;`  


### **Syscall**: `int print_int(const char str[], int x)`

You will not be able to call `printf()` from the user-level test program to print the result of the sum produced by `add_three_integers()`. The reason is because `printf()` calls `write()`, which is not yet implemented in the current version of OS/161 that is being used in this assignment. As a result, calling `printf()` in the test program will cause an error (i.e., missing syscall). 

To print the result of the `add_three_integers()` from the test program, you will create another system call with a signature `int print_int(const char str[], int x)`. Again, because this system call does not exist in OS/161, you will need to implement all its steps in the kernel code, except for the test program since you will be testing it from your user-level test program for `sum_three_integers()`. 

The implementation of the kernel-level version of `print_int` is:  
```c
void sys_print_int(const char str[], int x) {
    kprintf("%s %d\n", str, x);
}
```



The executable file of the test program must be named `test_sum_integers`. The code to be implemented in the test program is given as follows:

#### Test program:  

```c
 #include <unistd.h> 
int main(){

  int s1 = add_three_integers(3, 5, 2);
  int s2 = add_three_integers(-5, 3, 1);

  print_int("s1=", s1);
  print_int("s2=", s2);

 ¬†return 0;
} 
```


## **Hints for completing the assignment**

- **You must `git clone` the assignment GitHub repository.** Any other option to obtain the kernel files is wrong (e.g., using the download option from GitHub, copying the files from another directory or any other place, forking the repository, invoking the files through an *ouija board*). By *git cloning* the repository, its files  will be under source control and you will be able to edit the source code and `commit/push` any changes into the correct assignment repository on the GitHub server (i.e., the repository created when you accept the assignment through GitHub Classroom). You should not work on any files from a previous assignment. Every `OS/161` assignment has its own specific source code that is provided with the assignment repository. Clone the assignment repository from inside `/root/workspace/` (from inside the container), and using the shell (command line).
 
-  **Update the file `kern/conf/conf.kern`**. In this assignment, you will add new files to the kernel source code. Whenever files are added to OS/161, the configuration files use be updated so *configure* can update the makefiles. Unless the new files are listed in `conf.kern`, they will not be known to the `makefile`, and therefore they will be ignored during the building of the new kernel. As a result, you must update the configuration file `kern/conf/conf.kern` to reflect the presence of any new file. 

- **Do not simply copy and paste the commands from the assignment description.** When reading the instructions for adding system calls, make sure you read the text of the description as well as the commands. You need to understand the steps and not simply copy commands. A few steps might be described only in the text and not explicit commands in the assignment description (e.g., re-configure the kernel, update `conf.kern` to reflect added files). As a result, just copying-and-pasting the listed commands might not work.

- **Test your kernel to make sure it works and read any error messages, if any are printed.** Read the error messages as they usually tell you what the problem is, e.g., undeclared function, syntax error, linking error, unknown library, unknown function.

- **Step-by-step solution.** If you need a reminder of the steps to add a new system call to `OS/161`, re-read the step-by-step guide to add the `hello()` system call, which is given here: 
- [Sample solution (Add a new system call to OS/161)](./hello_steps.md). 


## Automated testing
This repository tests the kernel automatically whenever new changes are pushed to the repository. To see the details of the tests, open the GitHub Actions tab and select the workflow of the test. The code passes the tests if a green checkmark (‚úÖ) appears besides the label of the latest commit. Failed tests are indicated by a red X (‚ùå).

## Cloning, building, and submitting 

### Start the CSE4001 container, and clone the assignment repo

 Start the `CSE4001` container: 
  ```bash
  docker start -i cse4001
  ```

  If the container fails to start, make sure the container is running by calling the `docker run` command. For details see notes: https://github.com/eraldoribeiro/UsingCSE4001_OS161/blob/main/RunningOS161_DockerDesktop.md
  
Clone the assignment repository. Do this from inside `/root/workspace/` in the `CSE4001` container. Use `git clone` or `gh repo clone`. 
    
```bash
cd /root/workspace
gh repo clone <assignment_repository_url>
```

### Build the `OS/161` kernel. 

Start by building the current version of the kernel that was just cloned, to ensure that it builds without errors. Open a *Terminal* window. Go into the directory of the repository that was cloned for this assignment, and run the script `build_os161` that is provided in the assignment repository. 
    
The script implements the steps to build both the `kernel` and `userland`. If you want to see the building steps, just open the file of the script in a text editor or read the detailed instructions on how to build `OS/161` (https://github.com/eraldoribeiro/UsingCSE4001_OS161/blob/main/README.md). 

```bash
cd <assignment_repository_url>
./build_os161 <assignment_number>
```

The script‚Äôs mode is set to executable. If it does not execute, call `bash build_os161 <assignment number>` .  If the build is successful, the script will print the following: 

```bash
Building done.
  
Now, run sys161 kernel from inside ~/os161/root/
```
### Testing the system call

To test the system call, just run the following command: 
```bash
sys161 kernel p testbin/test_sum_integers
```
The expected output (considering the hardcoded input values given in these instructions) is:
```bash
s1=10
s2=-1
```



### Submitting the assignment

To submit the assignment, you will `git commit` and `git push` the changes you made to the code so the changes are sent to the assignment repository on `GitHub.com`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Only add source code to the repository 

#### Add files manually instead of using `git add .` for all files 
Try your best to only add source code to the repository. Avoid adding executable and object files. Do not call  `git add .` to add all files. Instead, add files manually calling `git add <filename>`.

#### Clean up before committing üßπ
In addition to adding only the necessary files, remove binary files. The script `cleanup_before_committing` does that for you. Just run it from inside the CSE4001 container before any commit is done, i.e.: 
```shell
./cleanup_before_committing
```
This script will run `bmake clean` for the kernel directories and also for the `userland` directories.
